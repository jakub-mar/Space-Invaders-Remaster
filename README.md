# Space-Invaders-Remaster
This is the remaster of The Space Invaders Game from my 2nd semester. 
The game is based of the popular Japanese game from 1978. The basic idea of the game is copied - you have to kill space invaders and stay alive, but the 
game mechanics were made by me - I don't know if it is the same as in the original game. 

## Description 
The base of this project is the game I made on 2nd semester, and which is a trash, so I started to make it better. 
All of the textures and sounds used in this game are free licensed or free commercial licensed. Some of the textures were made by myself.
I HAVE NO INTENTION OF MAKING MONEY OF IT!

## Plans for the future
* Three difficulty levels ( based on a speed of the invaders movement and shooting frequency i think)
* Special events during the game, like flying asteroids
* Better scoring system
